11 out of 18 given. 7 to fill.
Total time taken = 23094 milliseconds or 23 seconds.
Out of that 23088 milliseconds or 23 seconds were spent actually solving

797 nodes were visited.
Out of that 50 were leafs and 797 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 50 iterations.
The average search depth was 15.94
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
