15 out of 18 given. 3 to fill.
Total time taken = 404 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 404 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

15 nodes were visited.
Out of that 1 were leafs and 15 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 1 iterations.
The average search depth was 15.0
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
