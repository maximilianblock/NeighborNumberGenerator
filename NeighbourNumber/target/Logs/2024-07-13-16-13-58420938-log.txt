5 out of 18 given. 13 to fill.
Total time taken = 2839 milliseconds or 2 seconds.
Out of that 2838 milliseconds or 2 seconds were spent actually solving

77 nodes were visited.
Out of that 10 were leafs and 77 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 10 iterations.
The average search depth was 7.7
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
