18 out of 18 given. 0 to fill.
Total time taken = 41 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 41 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

18 nodes were visited.
Out of that 1 were leafs and 18 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 1 iterations.
The average search depth was 18.0
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
