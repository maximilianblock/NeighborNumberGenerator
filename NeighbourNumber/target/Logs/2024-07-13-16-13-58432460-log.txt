13 out of 18 given. 5 to fill.
Total time taken = 159 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 158 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

150 nodes were visited.
Out of that 50 were leafs and 100 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 50 iterations.
The average search depth was 16.0
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
