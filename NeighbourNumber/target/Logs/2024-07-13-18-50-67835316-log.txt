12 out of 18 given. 6 to fill.
Total time taken = 63 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 63 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

38 nodes were visited.
Out of that 25 were leafs and 13 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 1 iterations.
The average search depth was 12.0
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
