Out of that 6602 milliseconds or 6 seconds were spent actually solving

367 nodes were visited.
Out of that 179 were leafs and 188 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 10 iterations.
The average search depth was 9.1
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
