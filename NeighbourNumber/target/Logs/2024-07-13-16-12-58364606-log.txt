14 out of 18 given. 4 to fill.
Total time taken = 501 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 501 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

164 nodes were visited.
Out of that 10 were leafs and 164 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 10 iterations.
The average search depth was 16.4
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
