Out of that 2402 milliseconds or 2 seconds were spent actually solving

812 nodes were visited.
Out of that 50 were leafs and 812 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 50 iterations.
The average search depth was 16.24
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
