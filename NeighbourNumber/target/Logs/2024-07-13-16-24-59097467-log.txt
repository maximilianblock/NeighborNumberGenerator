9 out of 18 given. 9 to fill.
Total time taken = 6916 milliseconds or 6 seconds.
Out of that 6915 milliseconds or 6 seconds were spent actually solving

449 nodes were visited.
Out of that 100 were leafs and 349 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 100 iterations.
The average search depth was 14.51
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
