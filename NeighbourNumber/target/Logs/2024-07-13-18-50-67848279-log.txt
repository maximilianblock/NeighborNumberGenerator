10 out of 18 given. 8 to fill.
Total time taken = 974 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 974 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

418 nodes were visited.
Out of that 258 were leafs and 160 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 10 iterations.
The average search depth was 10.5
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
