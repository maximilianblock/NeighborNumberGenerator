10 out of 18 given. 8 to fill.
Total time taken = 858 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 858 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

52 nodes were visited.
Out of that 10 were leafs and 42 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 10 iterations.
The average search depth was 13.8
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
