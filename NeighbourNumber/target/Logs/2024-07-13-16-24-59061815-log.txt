Out of that 326 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

288 nodes were visited.
Out of that 100 were leafs and 188 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 100 iterations.
The average search depth was 16.12
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
