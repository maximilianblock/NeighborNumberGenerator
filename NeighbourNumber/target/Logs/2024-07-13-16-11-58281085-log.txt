11 out of 18 given. 7 to fill.
Total time taken = 143 milliseconds or 0 seconds.
Out of that 143 milliseconds or 0 seconds were spent actually solving

8 nodes were visited.
Out of that 1 were leafs and 7 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 1 iterations.
The average search depth was 11.0
Search direction was Top Down, meaning from the solved puzzle hints were removed.
