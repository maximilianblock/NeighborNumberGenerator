13 out of 18 given. 5 to fill.
Total time taken = 4169 milliseconds or 4 seconds.
Out of that 4163 milliseconds or 4 seconds were spent actually solving

1589 nodes were visited.
Out of that 100 were leafs and 1589 were non leafs.

Probabilistic search was used with 100 iterations.
The average search depth was 15.89
Search direction was Bottom Up, meaning to the empty puzzle hints were added.
